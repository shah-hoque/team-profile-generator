## Description
This application can be deployed via a command-line interface, where the user will be presented with a series of prompts. The response will be used to populate a HTML file that showcases basic information about a team.

The benefit of the application is that it can serve as central point of reference to find out basic information like email address and GitHub username of colleagues. This will prevent the need to interrupt a person to get this basic information.

The user will first be prompted to enter information about the manager, then the user will be given the option to add information about either an engineer or an intern.

Below are the questions that will be asked:

Manager questions:
- What is the team manager's name?
- What is the team manager's employee ID?
- What is the team manager's email address?
- What is the team manager's office number?

Engineer questions:
- What is the engineer's name?
- What is the engineer's employee ID?
- What is the engineer's email address?
- What is the engineer's GitHub username?

Intern questions:
- What is the intern's name?
- What is the intern's employee ID?
- What is the intern's email address?
- What is the intern's school?

## Installation
The user should follow these steps to be able to run the application:

1. Download Node.js on their computer if it's not already installed
2. In the terminal, go to the directory path where the application in question resides
3. Type 'npm install' in the terminal to download the applications dependencies
4. Type 'node index.js' in the terminal to initiate the application

For continued use, only step 4 is required which will overwrite the generated HTML file

## Usage
The application can only be used on a computer that has a command-line interface
